# Grade-Calculator-App
The purpose of this app is to calculate a student's GPA (and letter grade) based on the grades they get from their assignment, tests and exams.

The inspiration for this app comes from personal experience as a uni student. Calculating your GPA can be a tedious and time-consuming task however this app aims to resolve this issue by making the process quick and simple.

Note: Hoping to create this over the summer once uni is over.

## How does the app work?
Throughout the year, users can input the grades they get for their assignments, tests and exams. The app will track their progress accordingly and display their current GPA. Other features include a goal-setting feature which will allow students to set the GPA they are aiming for and the app will calculate what grades they need to achieve that goal. 

## Who are the users?
Victoria University of Wellington students. Future versions of the app could expand to include other universities as well.
